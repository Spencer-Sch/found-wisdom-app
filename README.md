## Description

### The Inspiration

Throughout my journey of self-improvement, I have collected many inspirational quotes and helpful thoughts in the notes app on my phone.

### The Problem

I am a very visually organized person. If I don't see something on a regular basis I forget about it. I have all of this _**found wisdom**_ on my phone meant to encourage me throughout my days that I never see because it's hidden.

### The Solution

I am building this app to regular injection these encouraging words into my life. I hope others will also find it useful.
